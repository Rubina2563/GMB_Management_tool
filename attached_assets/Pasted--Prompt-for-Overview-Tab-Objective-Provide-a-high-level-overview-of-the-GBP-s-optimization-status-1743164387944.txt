Objective:

Provide a high-level overview of the GBP’s optimization status across multiple categories, using real data to calculate scores and generate recommendations.

Backend Logic:

Fetch Data:
Use GBP API (locations.get, locations.reviews.list, locations.localPosts.list, locations.getGoogleUpdates) to fetch profile data, reviews, posts, and performance metrics.
Use DataForSEO API (Google Business Profile Keywords, Google Business Profile Citations, Google Business Profile Competitors) for keyword, citation, and competitor data.
Calculate Scores:
Keyword Optimization: Analyze keyword presence in description, posts, and services (DataForSEO + NLP with spaCy).
Review Response: Calculate response rate and average response time (GBP API).
Posting Schedule: Check post frequency and timing (GBP API).
Citation Prioritization: Identify citation opportunities (DataForSEO).
Performance: Use current metrics (calls, website clicks, direction requests) to assess performance (GBP API).
Competitor Benchmarking: Compare metrics like photo count and review response rate (DataForSEO + GBP API).
Generate Recommendations:
Use NLP (spaCy/OpenAI) to analyze data and suggest actions (e.g., "Your review response rate is low—respond to reviews within 24 hours").
Include manual flows where needed (e.g., "Copy this keyword and add it to your GBP description: [link to GBP]").
Frontend Design:

Background: bg-white (#FFFFFF) for the main content area.
Score: Display the overall score (e.g., 70/100) in text-orange-base (#F97316), 16px Montserrat font.
Category Scores:
Card: bg-white border border-gray-200 (#FFFFFF background, #E5E7EB border).
Text: text-black (#000000) for category names, text-gray-500 for scores.
Progress bars: Fill in bg-orange-base (#F97316), background in bg-gray-100.
Key Recommendations:
Card: bg-white border border-gray-200 (#FFFFFF background, #E5E7EB border).
Text: text-black (#000000) for recommendation text, text-orange-base (#F97316) for highlighted keywords or actions.
Buttons: Primary (bg-orange-base hover:bg-orange-light text-white) for actions like "Respond Now" or "Create Post".
Testing:

Verify that scores are calculated using real data (e.g., review response rate matches GBP data).
Ensure recommendations are actionable and include manual flows where needed.
Confirm styling aligns with the guide (e.g., white backgrounds, orange highlights).
