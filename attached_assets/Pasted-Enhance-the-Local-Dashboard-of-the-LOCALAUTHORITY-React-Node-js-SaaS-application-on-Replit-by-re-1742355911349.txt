Enhance the Local Dashboard of the "LOCALAUTHORITY" React + Node.js SaaS application on Replit by reorganizing the layout, adding prominent action cards, displaying all connected GBP locations with an expanded selected view and minimalist other views, introducing key metrics widgets, and adding quick filters and status indicators, using a consistent color scheme of white (#FFFFFF) background, black (#1C2526) top bar, and orange (#F28C38) accents:

- Backend (Node.js):
  - Update `/api/client/local-dashboard`:
    - Fetch all connected GBP locations (from `/api/auth/google-connect` or SQLite `locations` table).
    - Include location data: Location Name, Address, Phone, Website, Overall Ranking (average GBP Map Ranking position from `/api/client/local-ranking/gbp-map-rankings`), Ranking Trend (compare to previous period, e.g., last 7 days), and Status (Active/Pending/Suspended from Google Business Profile API).
    - Include key metrics (filterable by timeframe: Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days):
      - Reviews: Total count, average rating (from `/api/client/reputation-management`).
      - Posts: Total count, average views, last post date (from `/api/client/content-management`).
      - Rankings: Average GBP Map Ranking position (from `/api/client/local-ranking/gbp-map-rankings`).
      - Citations: Total citations, missing high-priority (from `/api/client/local-links`).
    - Return: JSON with locations, selected `gbp_id`, metrics data, and quick stats for the selected location (Total Reviews, Average Rating, Last Post Date).
  - Credit System: 0 credits for dashboard data fetch (free action).

  - Update `/local-dashboard`:
    - **Top Bar**:
      - Keep black (#1C2526) background with orange (#F28C38) for active selections.
