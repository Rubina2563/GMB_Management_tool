Enhance the GBP Audit feature in the React + Node.js SaaS application on Replit by adding a comprehensive audit of GBP business information fields:

- Backend (Node.js):
  - Update "/api/client/gbp/audit" to include business information checks:
    - Fetch GBP data (mock Google Business Profile API): business name, categories (primary/secondary), services, tags/attributes, description, opening date, phone, chat link, website link, social profiles (Facebook, Twitter), location, service area, opening hours (day-by-day, special hours), photos/videos.
    - Evaluate:
      - Business Name: Check for keyword inclusion (e.g., "Plumbing" for a plumber) without stuffing.
      - Categories: Verify relevance (e.g., "Plumber" as primary, "Emergency Plumbing Service" as secondary).
      - Services: Ensure all services are listed and match offerings.
      - Tags/Attributes: Check for identity attributes (e.g., "Wheelchair accessible").
      - Description: Confirm length (>750 chars), keyword inclusion, no promotional language.
      - Opening Date: Verify presence (older businesses may rank better).
      - Phone: Ensure a local number is used.
      - Chat Link: Check if enabled.
      - Website Link: Confirm it points to a relevant page.
      - Social Profiles: Verify links are present and consistent.
      - Location/Service Area: Ensure accuracy of address and service area radius.
      - Opening Hours: Audit day-by-day hours for completeness, including special hours.
      - Photos/Videos: Check for >5 photos, presence of videos, virtual tours.
      - NAP Consistency: Compare NAP across GBP, website, and social profiles (mock comparison).
    - Add audit results to the existing report: Include pass/fail for each field and recommendations (e.g., "Add 200 chars to description", "Include 'Wheelchair accessible' attribute").
  - Update SQLite `gbp_audits` table to store new audit details (e.g., `business_info` JSON field).
  - Credit System: Ensure 1 credit per audit (already implemented).

- Frontend (React):
  - Update /client/gbp-audit:
    - Add "Business Information" section to the audit report:
      - Display each fieldâ€™s status (e.g., "Categories: Relevant", "Description: Too short, add 200 chars").
      - Use #F28C38 for pass icons, #E63946 for fail icons.
      - Recommendations: List with bullets (#1C2526 text), "Implement" button (#F28C38 with #FFFFFF text, hover #F5A461) per suggestion (mock action with toast: "Recommendation applied").
    - Recalculate overall score (0-100): Assign 30% weight to business information (e.g., 10 fields checked, 7 pass = 21/30).
  - Design:
    - Background: #FFFFFF.
    - Text: #1C2526 (primary), #D3D7D9 (secondary).
    - Framer Motion: Fade-in for cards, scale on hover for buttons.
    - Montserrat font: 24px bold headings, 16px body.

- Testing:
  - Verify all GBP fields are audited with actionable recommendations.
  - Confirm UI updates (pass/fail icons, recommendations) are consistent with existing design.
  - Ensure overall score updates correctly.
