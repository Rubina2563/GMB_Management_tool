Build the Posts feature in the client portal to enable creating, scheduling, and analyzing GBP posts, leveraging the linked Google account, while ensuring the design matches the existing SaaS color palette:

- Backend:
  - Add endpoints:
    - "/api/client/posts/create": Create a post for a selected GBP (mock Google API, support Update, Offer, Event, Product Post types). Include title, description, photo/video URL (mock upload), CTA (e.g., "Learn More"), start/end dates (for Offers/Events), coupon code, terms (for Offers).
    - "/api/client/posts/ai-generate": Generate post content using the selected LLM (OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, Grok). Use client’s API key if provided (free), otherwise our API (2 credits per generation). Prompt: "Generate a concise, engaging GBP post (under 1500 characters) for a [post type] post, using the seed keyword [keyword], GBP category [category], and optional topic [topic]. Include a strong CTA (e.g., 'Shop Now', 'Book Today'). Use a friendly, professional tone suitable for a local audience in [location]. Avoid phone numbers."
    - "/api/client/posts/schedule": Schedule a post for immediate posting or a future date/time (mock Google API).
    - "/api/client/posts/list": List all posts for a GBP (live, scheduled, expired).
    - "/api/client/posts/analytics": Fetch post metrics (mock Google API: views, CTA clicks) and UTM-tracked website clicks (mock Google Analytics).
    - "/api/client/posts/best-time": Analyze historical post metrics to suggest the best posting time for a GBP (mock analysis: e.g., "Wednesdays at 10 AM").
  - Store post data in SQLite: GBP ID, post type, content, status (live/scheduled/expired), schedule date, metrics (views, clicks), UTM parameters.
  - Implement credit system: 1 credit per post creation, 2 credits per AI generation if using our API.

- Frontend:
  - Create /client/posts with the following layout:
    - Left-Hand Sidebar: Retain gradient (#1C2526 to #0D1214), text #FFFFFF, active items #F28C38.
    - Right-Hand Pane:
      - Background: #FFFFFF (matches existing SaaS right-hand pane).
      - Text: #1C2526 (primary), #D3D7D9 (secondary).
      - Buttons: #F28C38 with #FFFFFF text, hover #F5A461.
      - Icons: #F28C38 with #1C2526 text/icon color (e.g., calendar icons, CTA icons).
  - Sub-Menu: "Create Post", "Scheduled Posts", "Analytics".
  - Create Post:
    - Dropdown to select a GBP (only those linked to active campaigns, #F28C38 border on focus).
    - Post Type selector (Update, Offer, Event, Product Post, #F28C38 buttons with #FFFFFF text).
    - Manual Input: Title, description (1500 char limit), photo/video URL (mock upload), CTA dropdown (#F28C38), start/end dates (for Offers/Events), coupon code, terms.
    - AI Option: Toggle (#F28C38) to "Generate with AI". Inputs: Seed keyword (default from Campaigns), GBP category (auto-filled), optional topic. Cost: 2 credits (our API), free (client’s API key). Editable text area with "Regenerate" button (#6B5B95).
    - Visual Preview: Mock Google Search layout (glassmorphism, #FFFFFF background, border #F28C38).
    - Scheduling: "Post Immediately" or "Schedule" with date picker (default current time, #F28C38 button with #FFFFFF text).
  - Scheduled Posts:
    - Calendar View: Default Month, buttons/dropdown for Month/Week/Day (react-big-calendar).
    - Post Cards: Glassmorphism (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8), blur(10px), border #F28C38), text #1C2526.
    - Features:
      - Best Time Suggestion: Display "Suggested Posting Time: [e.g., Wed 10 AM]" (#6B5B95 text).
      - Expiration Reminder: Toast notification 1 day before expiration (#F28C38).
      - Evergreen Queue: Option to mark posts as "Evergreen" and auto-re-queue (toggle #F28C38).

  - Notifications:
    - In-app: Toast (#F28C38 with #FFFFFF text) for post creation, scheduling, and expiration reminders.
    - Email: Mock notification for scheduled posts going live.

- Design:
  - Use #F28C38 for buttons/icons, #6B5B95 for charts, #E63946 for alerts (e.g., failed posts).
  - Framer Motion: Fade-in for cards, scale on hover for buttons.
  - Montserrat font: 24px bold headings, 16px body.

- Interdependencies:
  - Use keywords from Campaigns for AI generation.
  - Sync post data to Reports for PDF export (js-pdf).

- Testing:
  - Verify GBP selection only shows campaign-linked GBPs.
  - Test AI generation with different LLMs and cost deduction.
  - Ensure calendar views (Month/Week/Day) render correctly.
  - Validate analytics metrics and UTM tracking.
  - Confirm color consistency with existing sections (e.g., Campaigns wizard).
