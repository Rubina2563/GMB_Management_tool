Instruct the "LOCALAUTHORITY" React + Node.js SaaS application on Replit to use the Google Natural Language API for sentiment analysis, leveraging the shared Google API credentials set up in the admin panel.

### Purpose of Google Natural Language API
- **Role**: Performs sentiment analysis on GBP reviews, classifying them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
- **Use Cases**:
  - **Reviews Page**: Analyzes review text to display a sentiment distribution pie chart (Positive: Green, Neutral: Yellow, Negative: Red) and extract key phrases (e.g., "great service" for Positive).
- **Field Testing Goal**: Ensure sentiment analysis is accurate and consistent, providing actionable insights into customer feedback for local SEO optimization.

### Backend (Node.js)
- Update `/api/client/gbp-audit/reviews/sentiment`:
  - Retrieve the shared `apiKey` from the stored credentials (e.g., `.env` or `apiCredentials` collection).
  - Use the `googleapis` Node.js library to make API calls to the Natural Language API (`https://language.googleapis.com/v1/documents:analyzeSentiment`).
  - For each review:
    - Classify sentiment as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
    - Extract key phrases contributing to sentiment.
  - Return: JSON with `{ sentimentDistribution: { positive: 70, neutral: 20, negative: 10 }, keyPhrases: { positive: ["great service"], neutral: [], negative: ["long wait"] } }`.
  - **Error Handling**:
    - If the API key is missing, return a 401 error: `{ error: "Google Natural Language API not configured" }`.

### Frontend (React)
- Update `/client/gbp-audit/reviews`:
  - Display the sentiment distribution as a pie chart (using Chart.js):
    - Positive: Green (#28A745).
    - Neutral: Yellow (#F5A461).
    - Negative: Red (#E63946).
  - List key phrases for each sentiment category below the chart.

### Testing
- Test the Reviews page to ensure sentiment analysis is accurate and the pie chart displays correctly.
- Verify that key phrases are extracted and displayed for each sentiment category.
- Ensure error handling works if the API key is invalid or missing.
