Develop the "Local Dashboard" tab under the "Dashboard" menu in the "LOCALAUTHORITY" React + Node.js SaaS application on Replit. Enhance the "GBP Insights" section with detailed, visually appealing metrics. Ensure the design aligns with the existing client panel, with all text in black (#000000) for visibility against the white background.

Objective
Purpose: Improve the "GBP Insights" section to:
Show views and actions over time with line graphs.
Display engagement metrics (clicks to website, direction requests, phone calls).
Include comparisons to the previous period.
Field Testing Goal: Deliver actionable GBP performance insights with an engaging, glanceable design.
Backend Requirements
Step 1: Modify the Existing Endpoint for Dashboard Data:
Endpoint: Enhance the existing dashboard data endpoint (e.g., /api/client/dashboard).
Purpose: Include detailed GBP insights.
Response Data:
viewsOverTime: Array of { date, views } (e.g., [{ date: "2023-01-01", views: 100 }, ...]).
actionsOverTime: Array of { date, actions } (e.g., [{ date: "2023-01-01", actions: 50 }, ...]).
engagementMetrics: Object with:
clicksToWebsite: Number (e.g., 50).
directionRequests: Number (e.g., 30).
phoneCalls: Number (e.g., 20).
comparison: Object with:
viewsChange: Percentage (e.g., 15).
actionsChange: Percentage (e.g., -5).
Example: { viewsOverTime: [...], actionsOverTime: [...], engagementMetrics: { clicksToWebsite: 50, ... }, comparison: { viewsChange: 15, ... } }.
Logic:
Fetch data from Google Business Profile API or database.
Calculate percentage changes based on the selected timeframe.
Frontend Requirements
Step 1: Enhance the "GBP Insights" Section:
Location: Update the "GBP Insights" section in the "Local Dashboard" tab.
New Elements:
Views Over Time: Line graph.
Actions Over Time: Line graph.
Engagement Metrics: Cards for clicks, directions, calls.
Comparison Indicators: Percentage changes (e.g., "+15% Views").
Styling:
Graphs with orange lines (#F28C38), black text (#000000).
Cards with white backgrounds, orange accents (#F28C38), black text (#000000, 16px Montserrat).
Comparison: Green (#28A745) for positive, red (#E63946) for negative.
Interactivity:
Timeframe selector (e.g., 7 days, 30 days) updates graphs.
"View Detailed Insights" link navigates to a detailed page.
Design:
All text in black (#000000).
Graph loading animations with Framer Motion.
Testing
Test Case 1: Data Display:
Verify graphs show correct views and actions.
Check engagement cards display accurate numbers.
Confirm comparison indicators match backend data.
Test Case 2: Interactivity:
Change timeframe and ensure graphs update.
Click "View Detailed Insights" and verify navigation.
Test Case 3: Visual Elements:
Ensure all text is black (#000000).
Verify styling consistency with the app.
