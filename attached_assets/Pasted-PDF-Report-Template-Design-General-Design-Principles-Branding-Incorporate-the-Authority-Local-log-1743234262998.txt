Implementation Notes
PDF Generation Library: Use a library like pdfkit (Python) or jsPDF (JavaScript) to generate the PDF. These libraries support HTML-to-PDF conversion, allowing you to style the report using Tailwind CSS classes (as per your style guide) and then convert it to PDF.
Branding: Ensure the "Authority Local" logo is high-resolution and placed consistently on each page. If you provide the logo or its dimensions, I can adjust the placement further.
Timestamps: Dynamically insert the report generation date (e.g., "March 28, 2025") using the current date at the time of generation.
Commentary: Use NLP (e.g., spaCy/OpenAI) to generate insightful commentary for each data point, graph, or chart, ensuring it’s actionable and specific to the client’s data.
