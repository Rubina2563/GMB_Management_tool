Develop a new "Local Organic Rankings" tab under the "Local Rankings" menu in the "LOCALAUTHORITY" React + Node.js SaaS application on Replit. This tab will focus on tracking organic keyword rankings for websites associated with the selected campaign, providing a detailed view of keyword performance over time. The design should align with the existing GBP Map Rankings screen, ensuring all text is black (#000000) for visibility against the white background, and tab bars (for switching between tabs like "GBP Map Rankings" and "Local Organic Rankings") should have a black background (#000000) with white text (#FFFFFF) when unselected, and an orange background (#F28C38) with white text (#FFFFFF) when selected. Do not include keyword research features, as they are not relevant for this tab.

### Objective
- **Purpose**: Create a "Local Organic Rankings" tab that allows users to:
  - View organic keyword rankings for the website associated with the selected campaign.
  - Track changes in rankings over time, including position changes, historical trends, and key metrics.
  - Filter and sort keywords to analyze performance effectively.
- **Field Testing Goal**: Ensure the tab provides a clear and actionable view of organic keyword rankings, aligns with the app’s design (black text on white background), and allows users to interact with the data (e.g., filtering, sorting, viewing trends).

### Backend Requirements
- **Step 1: Create a New Endpoint for Organic Keyword Rankings**:
  - **Endpoint**: Create a new endpoint under the "Local Rankings" menu to fetch organic keyword rankings for the selected campaign (e.g., `/api/client/local-organic-rankings`).

      - `tags`: Array of tags associated with the keyword (e.g., ["urgent", "health"]).
      - `currentRank`: The current organic rank (e.g., 100).
      - `previousRank`: The rank from the previous scan (e.g., 100).
      - `change`: The change in rank since the last scan (e.g., 0 for no change, +5 for improved, -3 for declined).
      - `bestRank`: The best rank ever achieved for this keyword (e.g., 94).
      - `searchVolume`: The monthly search volume for the keyword (fetched via DataForSEO, e.g., 5400).
      - `cpc`: The cost-per-click for the keyword (fetched via DataForSEO, e.g., 6.03).
      - `competition`: The competition level for the keyword (fetched via DataForSEO, e.g., 0.02, on a scale of 0-1).
      - `lastUpdated`: The date and time of the last rank check (e.g., "24/03/2025 13:56").
      - `history`: An array of historical rank data for the keyword within the selected date range, with each entry including:
        - `date`: The date of the scan (e.g., "2025-03-20").

  - **Logic**:
    - Retrieve the user’s selected campaign and validate it.
    - Fetch the website URL, location, and language from the campaign configuration.
    - Query the `rankingHistory` collection (or a new collection like `organicRankingHistory`) to get the organic keyword rankings for the campaign’s website.
    - Filter the historical data based on the `dateRange` parameter (or `startDate` and `endDate` for custom ranges).
    - For each keyword:
      - Fetch the current rank, previous rank, and historical ranks using DataForSEO or Google Search API (based on admin preference, similar to the GBP Map Rankings setup).
      - Calculate the rank change by comparing the current rank to the previous rank.
      - Determine the best rank by finding the lowest rank in the historical data.
      - Fetch search volume, CPC, and competition from DataForSEO.
      - Include any tags associated with the keyword (if a tagging system exists, or allow for future implementation).
    - Calculate summary metrics:
      - Count the total keywords, keywords up/down/no change, and keywords in top 3/10/100 positions.
      - Estimate the project value by multiplying the search volume by the CPC for each keyword and summing the results.
    - Sort the keyword rankings based on the `sortBy` and `sortOrder` parameters.
    - Return the campaign details, keyword rankings, and summary metrics in the response.

      - Ensure all text in the table (headers, cells, tags) is black (#000000, 16px Montserrat for body, 18px bold Montserrat for headers).
      - Color-code the "Change" column:
        - Green (#28A745) for upward arrows (improved ranks).
        - Red (#E63946) for downward arrows (declined ranks).
        - Gray (#CCCCCC) for right arrows (no change).
    - **Filters and Sorting**:
      - Add a filter bar above the table with the following options:
        - Date Range Selector: Options for "Last 7 Days", "Last 30 Days", "Last 90 Days", and "Custom Range" (with a date picker).

      - Ensure all text in the pop-up (headings, labels, graph text) is black (#000000, 16px Montserrat for body, 18px bold for headings).
  - **Design**:
    - Use the app’s existing color scheme:
      - Primary color: #F28C38 for buttons and highlights.
      - Positive: #28A745 (Green).
      - Negative: #E63946 (Red).
      - Neutral: #CCCCCC (Gray).
    - Ensure all text (headings, subheadings, labels, tooltips, table content, etc.) is black (#000000):
      - Headings: 20px bold Montserrat.
      - Subheadings: 18px bold Montserrat.
      - Body text: 16px Montserrat.
      - Small text (e.g., in tooltips, labels): 14px Montserrat.
    - Add subtle animations using Framer Motion:
      - Fade-in animation for the entire tab when it loads.
      - Scale animation on hover for table rows, filter buttons, and action icons.

### Testing
- **Test Case 1: Data Display**:
  - Select a campaign with tracked keywords and verify that the "Local Organic Rankings" tab displays:
    - The campaign’s website URL, location, language, and check frequency in the header.
    - Summary metrics cards with total keywords, keywords up/down/no change, top 3/10/100, and project value.
    - A table listing all keywords with their rankings, changes, search volume, CPC, competition, and last updated date.
- **Test Case 2: Visual Elements**:
  - Ensure all text in the header, summary cards, table, filters, and pop-ups is black (#000000).
  - Verify that the tab bar has a black background with white text when unselected, and an orange background with white text when selected.
  - Check that the "Change" column uses the correct colors for arrows (green for up, red for down, gray for no change).
  - Confirm that the trend pop-up displays a line graph with black text for all labels and headings.
- **Test Case 3: Interactivity**:
  - Test the date range selector and verify that the table and trend pop-up update to show data for the selected range.
  - Test the sort by and sort order options and confirm that the table updates accordingly.
  - Click the "Trend" action button for a keyword and verify that the pop-up opens with a line graph showing the rank history, with all text in black.
  - Test the "Clear Filters" button and ensure it resets all filters.
- **Test Case 4: Error Handling**:
  - Test with a campaign that has no tracked keywords and verify that the tab displays a message like "No keywords tracked for this campaign" (in black text, #000000, 16px Montserrat).
  - Test with a failed DataForSEO API call for search volume/CPC/competition and ensure the table displays "N/A" for those fields (in black text, #000000, 16px Montserrat).
