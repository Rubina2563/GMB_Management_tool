Prompt 2: Replace Optimization Progress with Onboarding and Exploration Features
Develop the "Local Dashboard" tab under the "Dashboard" menu in the "LOCALAUTHORITY" React + Node.js SaaS application on Replit. Remove the "Optimization Progress" sections and introduce onboarding and exploration features for new users. Ensure the design aligns with the existing client panel, with all text in black (#000000) for visibility against the white background.

Objective
Purpose: Enhance the "Local Dashboard" tab by:
Removing "Optimization Progress" sections.
Adding an onboarding placeholder for new users.
Including an "Explore the App" section for feature navigation.
Field Testing Goal: Provide a welcoming, informative experience for new users, guiding them through onboarding and app exploration.
Backend Requirements
Step 1: Modify the Existing Endpoint for Dashboard Data:

Purpose: Add a flag to identify new users.
Response Data:
isNewUser: Boolean indicating if the user has incomplete onboarding (e.g., true).

Check onboarding steps (e.g., Google account connected, location added, campaign started).
Set isNewUser to true if any step is incomplete.
