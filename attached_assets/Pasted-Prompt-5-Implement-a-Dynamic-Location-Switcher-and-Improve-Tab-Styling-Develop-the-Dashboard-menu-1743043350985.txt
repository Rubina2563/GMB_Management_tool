Prompt 5: Implement a Dynamic Location Switcher and Improve Tab Styling
Develop the "Dashboard" menu in the "LOCALAUTHORITY" React + Node.js SaaS application on Replit. Implement a dynamic location switcher and improve tab styling for consistency. Ensure the design aligns with the existing client panel, with all text in black (#000000) for visibility against the white background, and tab bars styled with a black background (#000000) and white text (#FFFFFF) when unselected, and an orange background (#F28C38) with white text (#FFFFFF) when selected.

Adding a dynamic location switcher dropdown.
