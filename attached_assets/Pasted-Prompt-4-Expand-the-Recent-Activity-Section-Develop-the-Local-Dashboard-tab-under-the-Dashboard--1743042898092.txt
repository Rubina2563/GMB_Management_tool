Prompt 4: Expand the Recent Activity Section
Develop the "Local Dashboard" tab under the "Dashboard" menu in the "LOCALAUTHORITY" React + Node.js SaaS application on Replit. Expand the "Recent Activity" section with detailed, actionable activities. Ensure the design aligns with the existing client panel, with all text in black (#000000) for visibility against the white background.

Objective
Purpose: Enhance the "Recent Activity" section to:
Include diverse activities (reviews, posts, rank changes, citations, audits).
Provide timestamps, descriptions, and action links.
Add activity type filters.
Field Testing Goal: Offer a comprehensive, actionable overview of recent events for user engagement.
Backend Requirements
Step 1: Modify the Existing Endpoint for Dashboard Data:
Endpoint: Enhance the existing dashboard data endpoint (e.g., /api/client/dashboard).
Purpose: Include recent activities.
Response Data:
recentActivities: Array of objects with:
type: Activity type (e.g., "review", "post").
timestamp: DateTime (e.g., "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z").
description: Text (e.g., "Received a 5-star review").
actionLink: URL (e.g., "/reviews/123").
Example: [{ type: "review", timestamp: "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z", description: "Received a 5-star review from John Doe", actionLink: "/reviews/123" }, ...].
Logic:
Aggregate activities from relevant sources (reviews, posts, etc.).
Sort by timestamp (descending).
Limit to the last 10 activities.
Frontend Requirements
Step 1: Expand the "Recent Activity" Section:
Location: Update the "Recent Activity" section in the "Local Dashboard" tab.

Interactivity:
Filter by type updates the list.
Action links navigate or open modals.
Design:
All text in black (#000000).
Filter animations with Framer Motion.
