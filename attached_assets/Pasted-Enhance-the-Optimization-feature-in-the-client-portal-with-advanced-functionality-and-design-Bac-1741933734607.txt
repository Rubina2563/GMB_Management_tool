Enhance the Optimization feature in the client portal with advanced functionality and design:
- Backend:
  - Update the endpoint "/api/gbp/optimize" to:
    - Use admin-managed OpenAI to analyze GBP data, scrape competitor profiles (via SerpAPI), and internet trends based on primary keywords/categories.
    - Generate prioritized suggestions (high/medium impact) with mock actions (e.g., "Add 'emergency plumber' to keywords").
    - Apply approved changes to GBP via Google API (admin-managed).
  - Add endpoints:
    - "/api/gbp/category-optimize": Suggest categories based on top-ranking businesses (mock SerpAPI data), with ranking potential scores (e.g., 85/100).
    - "/api/gbp/keyword-optimize": Provide keywords with difficulty (1-10) and volume (mock DataForSEO data).
  - Store optimization history and sync to Reports and Rankings.
- Frontend:
  - Enhance /client/optimization within the SaaS layout:
    - Left-Hand Sidebar: Group under "GBP Insights" with sub-menus: "Dashboard", "Optimization" (AI Suggestions, Category Optimization, Keyword Optimization), "Rankings", "Reviews". Add a search bar (bg-[#c9c08f], text-[#006039]).
    - Right-Hand Pane:
      - Sub-menu: "AI Suggestions", "Category Optimization", "Keyword Optimization".
      - AI Suggestions: Display cards with suggestions (bg-[#c9c08f], text-[#006039]), "Apply" button (gold #a37e2c), progress bars (Framer Motion: animate width), color-coded impact (green #9eca9e, gold #a37e2c).
      - Category Optimization: Table comparing current vs. suggested categories with scores, approval toggle.
      - Keyword Optimization: List with difficulty, volume, "Save" button, priority slider (1-5).
    - Client Dashboard Widget: Add optimization progress (e.g., "75% optimized") with a mini-chart (Chart.js).
  - Design:
    - Animate cards (Framer Motion: rotate-in, scale hover) with glow on applied suggestions (#9eca9e shadow).
    - Gradient background (#f4f4f2 to #c9c08f).
    - Montserrat font (24px bold, 16px body).
  - Interdependencies:
    - Sync data to Rankings and Reports.
    - Update Client Dashboard "Recent Activity" (e.g., "Optimization applied").
