Step 2: Save Selected Profiles:
Add a new endpoint /api/client/gbp-audit/save-profiles:
Method: POST
Purpose: Save the user’s selected GBP profiles.
Request Body:
selectedProfiles: Array of profile names (e.g., ["locations/123", "locations/456"]).
Logic:
Retrieve the user’s GBP profiles from the database.
Filter the profiles to include only the selected ones:
javascript

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
const userId = req.session.user.id;
const allProfiles = await db.collection('gbpProfiles').findOne({ userId });
const selected = allProfiles.locations.filter(loc => selectedProfiles.includes(loc.name));
await db.collection('gbpProfiles').updateOne(
  { userId },
  { $set: { selectedProfiles: selected, lastUpdated: new Date() } }
);
res.json({ success: true });
Testing
Test Case 1: OAuth Flow:
Navigate to /local-dashboard.
Click the "Add new location" button and ensure you’re redirected to Google’s OAuth consent screen.
Sign in with a Google account, grant permissions, and verify you’re redirected back to /local-dashboard with the modal open.
Test Case 2: GBP Profile Import:
After OAuth redirect, verify that the modal opens and GBP profiles are fetched and displayed.
Select a few profiles, click "Save Selected Profiles", and ensure the modal closes and the dashboard updates to show the new profiles.
Test Case 3: GBP Data Retrieval:
Go to /client/gbp-audit/business and verify that business info is fetched for one of the selected profiles.
Go to /client/gbp-audit/reviews and verify that reviews are fetched.
Go to /client/gbp-audit/map-rankings and verify that geo-grid rankings work (using the toggle between DataForSEO and Google Places API).
Error Handling Tests:
Test with invalid credentials: Remove the Client ID from the stored credentials and verify the error message: "Google OAuth credentials not configured".
Test with an expired token: Manually expire the access token and verify that the refresh token is used to obtain a new one.
Test with a user who doesn’t have GBP profiles: Ensure an appropriate message is displayed in the modal ("No GBP profiles found").
