Update the color palette of the entire React + Node.js SaaS application and frontend website to align with the refined fitness-inspired aesthetic, ensuring no dark background on the right-hand pane:

- Frontend:
  - Apply the following refined palette:
    - Primary Colors:
      - Base Color (Left Sidebar Only): Dark Gray/Black (#1C2526) – Use exclusively for the left-hand sidebar background.
      - Gradient Accent (Left Sidebar Only): Dark Gray to Black (#1C2526 to #0D1214) – Apply as a vertical gradient in the left-hand sidebar only.
      - Right-Hand Pane Background: White (#FFFFFF) – Use as the primary background for the right-hand pane across all pages to maximize brightness and readability, with no dark background elements.
    - Secondary Colors:
      - Accent Color: Orange (#F28C38) – Use for primary buttons, call-to-action elements, highlights, underlines, and hover effects (e.g., button hovers, link underlines).
      - Gradient Accent: Orange to Light Orange (#F28C38 to #F5A461) – Use for button hover effects and subtle highlights (e.g., hover states on cards).
    - Supporting Colors:
      - Text Color (Right-Hand Pane): Dark Gray/Black (#1C2526) – Primary text color for readability on the white (#FFFFFF) background.
      - Text Color (Left Sidebar): White (#FFFFFF) – Primary text color for readability on the dark sidebar background.
      - Secondary Text/Background: Light Gray (#D3D7D9) – Use sparingly for secondary text, borders, or inactive states (e.g., disabled buttons, placeholder text) in the right-hand pane.
      - Tech Accent: Purple (#6B5B95) – Use for data visualizations, charts, or tech-related highlights (e.g., campaign rankings).
      - Alert/Indicator: Red (#E63946) – Use for critical notifications or indicators (e.g., low rankings, errors).

  - Accessibility:
    - Ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG AA standards (e.g., #1C2526 on #FFFFFF for text).
    - Test with WebAIM Contrast Checker to confirm readability.
  - Design Enhancements:
    - Apply #F28C38 for all interactive elements (buttons, links, underlines) with hover transitions to #F5A461.
    - Use Framer Motion for hover effects (e.g., scale buttons, fade-in cards).
    - Maintain Montserrat font (24px bold headings, 16px body text).
    - Use Heroicons with #1C2526 for icons in the right-hand pane, #FFFFFF in the sidebar, and #F28C38 for active states.
  - Consistency:
    - Ensure all buttons use #F28C38 with #F5A461 hover gradient.
    - Limit #6B5B95 and #E63946 to 5-10% of the design (e.g., charts, alerts).
    - Use #D3D7D9 sparingly for secondary elements to keep the right-hand pane predominantly white.

- Backend:
  - Update any API responses that include color-related data (e.g., campaign rankings, review statuses) to reflect the new palette (e.g., return color codes for rankings: #F28C38 for top 3, etc.).

- Testing:
  - Test the UI for visual consistency across all pages, ensuring no dark background appears in the right-hand pane.
  - Verify accessibility with a contrast checker (e.g., WebAIM).
  - Ensure animations (Framer Motion) remain smooth and performant.
