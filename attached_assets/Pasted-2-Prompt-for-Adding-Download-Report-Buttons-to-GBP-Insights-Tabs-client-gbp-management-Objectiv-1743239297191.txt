2. Prompt for Adding Download Report Buttons to GBP Insights Tabs (/client/gbp-management/)
Objective
Add Download Report buttons to each GBP Insights tab under /client/gbp-management/ (Overview, Keywords, Reviews, Posting, Citations, Performance, Competitors, Description Insights) to allow users to generate and download the corresponding PDF report directly from the tab. This provides an additional access point to the reports, complementing the /client/reports section.

Backend Requirements
Use the same endpoint as the Reports Section: /api/client/gbp/reports/generate.
The reportType in the request body will correspond to the specific tab (e.g., reportType: "overall" for the Overview tab).
Frontend Design for GBP Insights Tabs
For each tab (Overview, Keywords, Reviews, Posting, Citations, Performance, Competitors, Description Insights), add the following:

Button Placement:
Add a "Download Report" button in the top-right corner of each tab, below the tab score (e.g., "Score: 70/100").
Button Style: bg-orange-base hover:bg-orange-light text-white (#F97316, hover #FB923C, #FFFFFF text).
Interactivity:
Clicking the button triggers the /api/client/gbp/reports/generate endpoint with the appropriate reportType (e.g., reportType: "overall" for the Overview tab, reportType: "keywords" for the Keywords tab, etc.).
The generated PDF follows the template designed earlier and includes data specific to that tab.
Mapping of Tabs to Report Types
Overview Tab: Generates the "Overall GBP Performance Summary" report (reportType: "overall").
Keywords Tab: Generates the "Keyword Optimization Report" (reportType: "keywords").
Reviews Tab: Generates the "Review Management Report" (reportType: "reviews").
Posting Tab: Generates the "Posting Strategy Report" (reportType: "posting").
Citations Tab: Generates the "Citation Opportunities Report" (reportType: "citations").
Performance Tab: Generates the "Performance Overview Report" (reportType: "performance").
Competitors Tab: Generates the "Competitor Analysis Report" (reportType: "competitors").
Description Insights Tab: Generates the "Description Insights Report" (reportType: "description").

PDF Report Content (High-Level Structure)
Each report generated from either the /client/reports section or the individual GBP Insights tabs will follow the PDF template designed earlier (cover page, table of contents, report sections, action plan). The content will focus on:

Summary Data: High-level metrics (e.g., scores, key numbers) without detailed charts.
Commentary: Actionable insights for each section, generated using NLP (e.g., spaCy/OpenAI) to provide context and recommendations.
Action Plan: A consolidated list of recommendations at the end.
For example, the Review Management Report PDF might include:

Cover Page: Authority Local logo, client info (e.g., "Fitness Pro Studio"), timestamp (e.g., "March 28, 2025").
Table of Contents: Links to sections like "Review Analysis", "Recommendations", "Action Plan".
Review Analysis Section:
Summary: "Your review response rate is 65%, with 3 priority reviews needing attention."
Commentary: "Customers frequently mention 'high cost' in negative reviews. Addressing pricing transparency in your description can improve satisfaction."
Recommendations Section:
"Respond to the 3 priority reviews within 24 hours."
"Add pricing transparency to your description."
Action Plan: A numbered list of all recommendations.
Testing
Reports Section (/client/reports):
Verify that each placeholder card displays the correct title, description, and "Download Report" button.
Test the PDF generation for each report type, ensuring the template (cover page, table of contents, etc.) is followed.
Individual GBP Insights Tabs (/client/gbp-management/):
Confirm that the "Download Report" button appears in each tab and generates the correct report type.
Test the styling of the button (bg-orange-base hover:bg-orange-light text-white).
PDF Content:
Ensure the PDF includes the Authority Local logo, timestamps, and client information.
Verify that the commentary is actionable and relevant to the report type.
