Add an Optimization (GBP Insights) section to the React + Node.js SaaS application on Replit to provide strategic recommendations for improving GBP performance, avoiding duplication with existing features:

- Backend (Node.js):
  - Add `/api/client/optimization/insights`:
    - Aggregate data from existing sections:
      - Campaigns: Primary keywords, geo-grid data.
      - Reviews: Sentiment analysis, review patterns.
      - Posts: Analytics (views, clicks), posting times.
      - GBP Audit: Performance metrics (calls, bookings, direction requests), business info.
      - Citations: Total citations, missing directories.
    - Implement features:
      - **Keyword Optimization**: Use DataForSEO Rank Tracker API to suggest new keywords based on competitor rankings. Return "Keyword Suggestion Score" (0-100).
      - **Review Response Optimization**: Analyze sentiment and suggest response priorities. Return "Response Impact Score" (0-100).
      - **Posting Schedule Optimizer**: Analyze post analytics to recommend optimal times. Return "Posting Efficiency Score" (0-100).
      - **Citation Building Prioritization**: Use DataForSEO backlink data to prioritize missing directories. Return "Citation Priority Index" (0-100).
      - **Performance Trend Forecasting**: Use GBP Audit metrics to predict next 3-month trends (mock linear regression). Return "Performance Forecast Score" (0-100).
      - **Competitor Benchmarking**: Compare GBP metrics with top 5 competitors. Suggest actions.
    - Return: JSON with scores, recommendations, and benchmarking data.
  - Store insights in SQLite (`optimization_insights` table: insight_id, gbp_id, timestamp, data).
  - Credit System: 1 credit per insight generation (deduct from mock balance).

- Frontend (React):
  - Add `/client/optimization`:
    - Right-Hand Pane:
      - Background: #FFFFFF.
      - Text: #1C2526 (primary), #D3D7D9 (secondary).
      - Buttons: #F28C38 with #FFFFFF text, hover #F5A461.
      - Icons: #F28C38 with #1C2526 text/icon color.
    - Layout:
      - "Generate Insights" button (#F28C38) triggers `/api/client/optimization/insights`.
      - Sections:
        - **Keyword Optimization**: Suggest new keywords, display "Keyword Suggestion Score" (progress bar, #F28C38).
        - **Review Response Optimization**: Show priorities, "Response Impact Score" (progress bar).
        - **Posting Schedule Optimizer**: Recommend times, "Posting Efficiency Score" (progress bar).
        - **Citation Building Prioritization**: List priorities, "Citation Priority Index" (progress bar).
        - **Performance Trend Forecasting**: Show 3-month forecast, "Performance Forecast Score" (progress bar).
        - **Competitor Benchmarking**: Table of competitor gaps, suggested actions with "Implement" buttons (#F28C38).
      - "Export Insights" button (#F28C38) triggers PDF export using `js-pdf`.
  - Notifications:
    - Toast (bg-#F28C38, text-#FFFFFF) for insight generation ("Insights generated"), export ("PDF downloaded"), and credit deduction ("1 credit deducted").
  - Design:
    - Use #F28C38 for buttons/icons, #6B5B95 for charts, #E63946 for alerts.
    - Framer Motion: Fade-in for cards, scale on hover for buttons.
    - Montserrat font: 24px bold headings, 16px body.

- Interdependencies:
  - Pull data from Campaigns, Reviews, Posts, GBP Audit, and Citations.
  - Sync insights to Reports for PDF export.

- Testing:
  - Verify data aggregation and score calculations.
  - Test PDF export with all sections.
  - Confirm UI consistency with the updated sidebar design.
