Enhance the Reviews feature in the client portal with advanced functionality, AI-powered replies, and a unique design, integrating the following recommendations:

- Backend:
  - Update "/api/client/reviews/pull":
    - Pull reviews only from GBPs linked to active campaigns (cross-reference with the Campaigns table in SQLite).
    - Support filtering by date range (last 7/30/90 days) and rating (1-5 stars).
    - Cost: 1 credit per pull (deduct from client credit balance, mock implementation).
  - Add endpoints:
    - "/api/client/reviews/reply": Send a reply to a review (require manual approval via 'Send' button, mock Google API response).
    - "/api/client/reviews/bulk-reply": Handle bulk replies (generate AI suggestions for selected reviews, require approval via 'Review & Approve All' button, mock Google API).
    - "/api/client/reviews/request": Automate review requests (mock email/SMS via Twilio, admin-managed).
    - "/api/client/reviews/ai-suggest": Generate replies using the selected LLM (OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, Grok). Use client’s API key if provided (free), otherwise use our API (2 credits per reply). Prompt: "Generate a warm, empathetic, human-like reply to this review, incorporating the business’s primary keyword [keyword] and location [location]. For positive reviews, express gratitude and encourage future visits (e.g., 'We’re thrilled you loved our service at [location]! Come back soon!'). For negative reviews, apologize sincerely and offer a resolution (e.g., 'We’re so sorry about your experience at [location]. Please contact us to resolve this!'). Avoid robotic phrasing; use casual, friendly tones."
    - "/api/client/reviews/notify": Send in-app and email notifications (mock) for new reviews and failed replies, including review details and a retry link.
  - Store review data in SQLite with timestamps, response status, failure flags, and sentiment analysis (mock).
  - Handle failed replies: Retry up to 3 times, mark as failed (flag in DB), display red badge, and send email notification (mock).
  - Add credit management: Track credits (mock balance) and deduct for pulls (1 credit) and AI replies (2 credits if using our API).

- Frontend:
  - Add Settings in Client Dashboard:
    - "Review Sync Settings": Toggle options "Daily (1 credit/day)" and "On-Demand (1 credit/pull)" with a visual switch (#F28C38 active, #D3D7D9 inactive), "Sync Now" button (#F28C38), and credit balance display (e.g., "150 Credits").
    - "AI Settings": Dropdown to select LLM (OpenAI, Claude, DeepSeek, Grok) or input API key, with cost breakdown ("Our API: 2 credits/reply, Your API: Free").
  - Enhance /client/reviews:
    - Left-Hand Sidebar: Group under "GBP Insights" with sub-menus: "Dashboard", "Optimization", "Campaigns", "Reviews" (All Reviews, Sentiment Analysis, Review Requests).

        - Columns: Date, Rating, Text, Status (e.g., "Replied", "Failed" in #E63946 with "Failed to Reply. Try Again" button).
        - Filters: Dropdowns for date range (7/30/90 days) and rating (1-5 stars), with real-time preview.
