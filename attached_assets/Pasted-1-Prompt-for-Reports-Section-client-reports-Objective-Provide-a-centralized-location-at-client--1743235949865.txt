1. Prompt for Reports Section (/client/reports)
Objective
Provide a centralized location at /client/reports for users to generate and download actionable PDF reports for various aspects of their Google Business Profile (GBP) optimization. Each report will be represented by a placeholder with a description of its purpose and content, avoiding duplication of charts or data already shown in the GBP Insights sections under /client/gbp-management/.

}
Logic:
Fetch Data: Retrieve the necessary data for the report from the GBP API and DataForSEO API, based on the reportType (e.g., reviews for the Review Management Report).
Generate PDF: Use a PDF generation library (e.g., pdfkit or jsPDF) to create the report following the template designed earlier (cover page, table of contents, report sections, action plan).
Store PDF: Save the generated PDF to a temporary storage location (e.g., AWS S3) and return a downloadable URL.
Branding: Include the Authority Local logo, timestamps, and client information in the PDF, as per the template.
